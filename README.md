# ProGraph RAG System

ProGraph RAG System is a cutting-edge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform that combines the power of knowledge graph creation with document-based query answering. It leverages Neo4j for graph database management, Groq's ChatGroq for advanced language processing, and Hugging Face embeddings for document vectorization. The system provides an intuitive interface for document upload, knowledge extraction, and querying, with a visually appealing 3D graph representation of relationships.

## Features

- **Document Upload**: Upload PDF documents to extract entities and relationships.
- **Knowledge Graph Creation**: Automatically generates a knowledge graph based on extracted entities and relationships.
- **Query Interface**: Ask questions based on the uploaded document and retrieve answers with graph-based insights.
- **3D Graph Visualization**: Interactive 3D visualization of the knowledge graph using Plotly.
- **Customizable Graph Settings**: Adjust node size, color, and edge properties for better visualization.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the user-friendly web interface.
- **Neo4j**: A graph database for storing and querying relationships.
- **Groq's ChatGroq**: For language processing and relationship extraction.
- **Hugging Face Embeddings**: For document vectorization and similarity-based retrieval.
- **Plotly**: To visualize relationships in a 3D graph.
- **LangChain**: To handle document loading, splitting, and RAG operations.

## Setup

### Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Neo4j instance running
- Groq API key for language processing
- Required Python libraries:
  - `neo4j`
  - `langchain`
  - `streamlit`
  - `plotly`
  - `networkx`
  - `pyvis`
  - `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/knowledge-graph-rag-system.git
   cd knowledge-graph-rag-system
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your Neo4j database and provide connection details in the `.env` file or directly in the script.

4. Get your **Groq API Key** by signing up on [Groq](https://www.groq.com/).

5. Update the configuration with the correct details:
   - **Neo4j URI**: Provide the URI of your running Neo4j instance.
   - **Neo4j Credentials**: Your Neo4j username and password.
   - **Groq API Key**: Your API key for ChatGroq.

### Running the Application

After setting up, run the Streamlit app with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the web application. You can upload a PDF document, query the system, and view the generated knowledge graph.

## Usage

1. **Upload a PDF Document**: Drag and drop a PDF document into the upload box to extract entities and relationships.
2. **Query the Knowledge Base**: Enter a question related to the document, and the system will return an answer generated by the language model and display the related entities from the knowledge graph.
3. **Visualize Knowledge Graph**: View the 3D visualization of the knowledge graph, showing the relationships between entities.

## Customization

- You can modify the graph visualization settings in the sidebar to adjust the appearance of the 3D graph.
- You can extend the functionality to support other document formats or improve entity extraction by enhancing the prompt to the ChatGroq model.
